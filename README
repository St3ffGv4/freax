freax
=====

This repository contains the surface line of the changes that have already been made and that need to be made into Freax.
It has also created to provide the user side a space where everyone can propose an issue, without having to look for the more suitable place/repository for where to report it, considering that the source code is made of multiple repositories and it is not always easy to identify the sector suitable for the type of the noticed issue.
